## How Did This All Start?

Many people ask the question, "How did ghost hunting begin?" There are a lot of stories about how and why ghost hunting began, but we will hit the high spots and unpack some of the more interesting topics. Ghost hunting dates back to the 19th century at the earliest, and it has only gained momentum again recently. 

### Early Beginnings 

1817: One of the first stories that caused ghost interest was the Bell Witch incident, or the Bell Witch Haunting. The Bell family lived in northwest Robertson County, Tennessee. According to the story, from 1817 - 1821, the family was attacked by a mostly invisible entity that was able to communicate via speaking, interact with the physical environment, and even shapeshift. 

In 1894, Martin V. Ingram, a newspaper editor, published the first full-length record of the story. According to the record, the witch claimed it wanted to kill the patriarch of the family. Many people were frightened away from investigating the incident, thinking they would be killed or beaten by the creature. The Bell Witch was the spark that started most of today's interest in ghost hunting. 

1833: The term "ghost hunter" was used for the first time in author Michael Banim's fictional novel, "The Ghost-Hunter and His Family."

1848: The Fox Sisters, residents of New York state, are credited with beginning **The Spiritual Movement**, which was a period of time that was similar to the paranormal interest we are seeing today. Live seances and use of Ouija boards were extremely popular during this time, and many people were claiming to be psychic to make easy money. The movement lost speed in the 1920's. 

1882: The Society for Psychical Research was founded in the U.K. as the result of a discussion between journalist Edmund Rogers and physicist William F Barrett. A committee was formed at the headquarters of the British National Association of Spiritualists, and the society was officially composed in February 1882. 

The purpose of the Society for Psychical Research is to understand events and abilities commonly described as psychic or paranormal. It claims itself as the first society to conduct organized, academic research into human experiences that challenge classic scientific models. The society exists to this day.

### How We Got Here
The fire for paranormal investigation died down around the 1920's with the end of **The Spiritual Movement**, and it didn't pick back up until the 1980's with new interest in haunted houses from the release of horror films. The 2000's seemed to carry a match for ghost hunting and spiritual sightings. Reality television shows, such as **Ghost Asylum** and **Paranormal Lockdown**, came out and piqued the interest of a new generation. Fictional shows, such as **Supernatural** and **Ghost Whisperer**, helped fan the flame of the paranormal. Not everyone liked the new interest, but some of us are a little too interested in the spiritual realm and love to investigate. Technology continues to improve, and it helps capture evidence of ghosts and spirits that roam the earth. We will cover technology upgrades in the next post, but happy ghost hunting in the meantime.
