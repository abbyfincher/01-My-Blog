Greetings, ghost hunters. For this post, I decided to take you along with me on a ghost hunt. This hunt did not involve high tech equipment. Rather, I and three of my friends used primitive ghost hunting technology in the form of flashlights and three cell phones. My phone recorded video, my friend Erin's phone recorded audio, and my friend Willow took photographs with her phone. This type of hunt is what I would describe as a basics-only hunt. Thermal imaging, infrared, spirit boxes, nor any other kind of high quality ghost hunting technology was in use for this ghost hunt.

### Methods

#### Video Recording

Video recording ghost hunts is one of the most beneficial ways to capture ghostly evidence because they can record shadow movement along a wall or help capture audio that a voice recording didn't. Ghost images aren't as apparent to the naked eye, so using something like a video recording to aid in catching a ghost is extremely helpful. I wish I had a night vision or thermal imaging camera because they are really the best on the market for capturing ghosts.

#### Photographing

Photographs are the classic means of finding ghosts. Many of us have seen old black and white photos that reveal a hazy face or body. Some researchers even think old cameras from the 1920's are the best for capturing ghost images rather than the fancy digital cameras of today. Today's cameras can be too high resolution and decrease the likelihood of seeing a ghost image in a photograph. Even some of today's cell phones cannot capture the essence of a spirit. The more primitive your camera, the better. Polaroids are still the best, in my opinion.

#### Audio/Tape Recording

The use of a tape or audio recorder is one of the best methods to capture evidence of voices from the beyond. We were lucky enough to encounter voices at two of our locations, which, I'll admit, was not expected. Listening back to our audio was chilling, especially at the last location we went to.Â My favorite way to capture evidence is using an audio recorder. However, you do have to be careful with background noise, as was an issue with one of our locations. I couldn't decipher anything, and I don't know if there were any responses. We may never know.

As I mentioned in the video, this was not what a full scale ghost hunt would be like. When done properly, you would research one location beforehand and set up your tech during the day. Cameras (thermal and night vision), audio recorders, response devices, and possibly spirit boxes would be set up in various locations to maximize your efficiency of capturing evidence. You would take the entire night for a single location rather than skipping around to locations. This was meant as an example of what you could do on a ghost hunt in means of gathering evidence. Whether you do this as a hobby or are looking into it for a little side cash, ghost hunting can be thrilling and will force you into a world that you do not fully understand.
